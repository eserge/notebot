# Naming conventions
Commit messages have several tags, which I put in the beginning of a message.
- `ft` - new functionality, feature
- `docs` - documentation
- `ref` - refactoring, should not include new functionality
- `mntn` - maintenance, technical backlog, something related only to the code or operations; should not include new functionality
- `test` - tests
